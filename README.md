# Client_Server_Connection

This project contain 3 important criteria: GUI DataBase and Server(Socket)

When the client type in there login name and password, it will immediately save in to database and our server at the same time.

For the UI part I choose to use JAVA GUI. For the DataBase part I use MySQL. For the Server part I use JAVA Socket.
First start the OrderServer, then we can start the test.java.

The UI part is quite straight forward, just type in your name and password.

The database part is also quite straight forward, it contains 3 column: customer_id, name and password.

 Everytime a new client register it will automatically generate a new row in out database.
